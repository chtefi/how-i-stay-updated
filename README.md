Here is how i stay up-to-date.

> Here, a blog post of this README I wrote after, with more details: http://ctheu.com/2016/10/23/are-you-up-to-date/

I'm a back-end guy, but I also did a lot of front-end, so I keep my front-end knowledge up to date. It's always useful when I want some quick UI to query some backend. Working in IT, you know continuous delivery, continuous integration etc. so you must learn Continuous Learning !

> Meaning, a lots of stuff to watch.

I can now point to this repo if someone asks me. :wink:

# Twitter 

Of course. [@chtefid](https://twitter.com/chtefid)

Posting a lot of links myself.

# Chrome

My "new tab" is using [tabbie](https://tabbie.io/) since it was created. I never removed it.

I'm using:

- github: best daily starred repos. I often discover nice repo with this.
- reddit: #programming #react #javascript #scala. I click when i see an interesting title.
- hackernews: often interesting topics and links. I go to the main website too, for the best.
- dribble: because designers are doing cool stuff :-)

# Bookmarks

I have a special folder "TO READ" where I bookmark for later. Before I was able to be stable around 10.
Right now, I have like >100 insides. Always read some on evenings.
Once, I tried pocket, but, for some reason, I didn't like it.

# Websites

- https://news.ycombinator.com/best: hackernews bests. often awesome or very interesting.

- [Data Elixir](http://dataelixir.com/): about... data as you guessed. I stopped this one. Interesting, about ML, and data in general.

# Github

I subscribed to some projects to read issues and PR and know where it's going but it's quite time consuming.
So I don't recommend it except if you are really into open-source.

# Videos

Of course, watching conferences and courses is a must.

- [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEBb1b_L6zDS3xTUrIALZOw)
- [Compressor Head](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIJGErt5rrCqaSGTMyyqNt2H) still need to finish that
- [Facebook Developers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP_lo1MFyx5IXDeD9s_6nUw) reactjs conferences, F8
- [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/) mass amount of talks with slides
- [Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net) sometimes, you just want to get details from slides because it's more succinct

# My Company

On Slack, we have a dedicated channels with moaaar links, and we share of that between us, about the topic we are working on.

# Training

Of course, training is essential.

I spent some time on:

- https://fr.coursera.org/: perfect when I want to get into unknown
- https://www.hackerrank.com/: always nice a have some challenges and discover new algorithms, mostly using Scala
- https://www.pluralsight.com/: less than coursera but I followed some stuff a while ago
- https://egghead.io/: nice free videos with react, redux, cycle and so on.

# Books

I have a dozen of pdfs on my desktop about interesting stuff (scala, tdd, hadoop, elastic, akka, ...). I've finished some, and started some others. Barely have time to read them.

I'm often reading a physical book aside. It's more practical to stay focus. Right now, it's about DDD, super interesting ([Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.amazon.fr/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215)).

# More

- [A guy learning everything who wants to work at google](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university) : lots of tech and data structure names to know

# Why

Because I love to know lots of stuff and do links between knowledges.

# Why it's hard

- Because my memory sucks and I'm sure I forget 90% of what I'm reading, and can't use it when needed
- Because I don't have a lot of free time to read and learn all that, but i'm trying, sleeping is overrated

# Why it's useful

- Because in about a year of that, I learned SO MANY things in a lot of domains nonetheless, and got better overall.

# Blog

Also, I maintain a [blog](http://ctheu.com/).

I mostly pick a topic or a framework I want to learn and share my findings. (using a lot of [gists](https://gist.github.com/chtefi) too)
It's useful because you try to not say stupid things and must verify your affirmations. 

I have a tons of drafts and titles, but it's very hard to find time to write the articles.
I often takes several evenings doing only that to make an article good enough for me.
I must improve on that part.
