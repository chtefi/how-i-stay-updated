Here is how i stay updated.

# Twitter 

Of course. [@chtefid](https://twitter.com/chtefid)

Posting a lot of links myself.

My "new tab" is using [tabbie](https://tabbie.io/) since it was created. I never removed it.

I'm using:

- github: best daily starred repos. I often discover nice repo with this.
- reddit: #programming #react #javascript. I click when i see an interesting title.
- hackernews: often interesting topics and links. I go to the main website too, for the best.
- dribble: because designers are doing cool stuff :-)
